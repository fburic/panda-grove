# Panda Grove

A lightweight package for easier management of multiple Pandas DataFrames.

Some inspiration is taken from database models to help track relationships between
DataFrames and facilitate operations between these, 
without the strong structural and data type enforcements.

The philosophy of Panda Grove is to assist without getting in the way or
creating yet another API on top of Pandas.


## Highlights

- `Collection` class to encapsulate and manage multiple DataFrames
- TODO: n-ary operations (e.g. merge across multiple DataFrames)
- TODO: schema and datatype management
