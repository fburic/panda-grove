Panda Grove is a lightweight package to help manage multiple Pandas DataFrames,
say when performing an analysis that involves juggling different tables
containing related, but scattered data.

With Panda Grove one can:

- perform merges (aka joins) on multiple DataFrames at once
- encapsulate and manage multiple DataFrames in a single Collection object
- perform sanity checks and datatype optimization
